  My name is Lizbeth Ibarra and I am from Richmond, California.
  I was born on April 29th, 2004.
  I am 15 years old and in the Fall, I'll be a sophomore at Making Waves Academy.
  I enjoy drawing, cooking, baking, and socializing.
  I like getting to know new people and listening to everything others have to say or think.
  I also like being really active an listening to music, I listen to almost everything.
  I always have a good time hiking, swimming, runnnig, playing basketball, and being outdoors.
  I am a lifeguard and I also teach swimming lessons during my free time in the Summer.
  I am the youngest sibling, with two older brothers and an older sister. My mom is from Chavinda, Michoacan and my dad is from Sahuayo, Michoacan.
  I was born in Berkeley, California, therefore, I am a Chicana.
  I love animals, I have two dogs and I used to have a hamster.

<p id="yay">
  Even though I try not to be, I'm kind of a picky eater. Especially when it comes to meat, that's why I usually eat chicken or meat substitutes.
  I really love fruit though.
  It is hard to choose favorite fruits because I love most of them, that's why I put smoothies.
  My favorite frozen yogurts toppings are popping boba and sliced almonds, I put them on top of taro froyo.
